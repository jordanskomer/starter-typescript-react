# React Typescript Starter

This is a starter repo to be used for learning React. It was originally create to skip the setup steps in this [free React course](https://www.udemy.com/course/typescript-with-react-hooks-and-context/)

## System Requirements

Ensure the following is installed (in order) on your machine before attempting to use any of the available scripts below

- [Node >= 14](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

## Getting Started

To get started with this repo all it takes is to ensure you have the above system requirements on your system and run `pnpm i`. Once that is finised you are good to use the scripts below. To quickly start locally run `pnpm start`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pnpm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:7000](http://localhost:7000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits in the src folder.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

_Note: Edits made in the public folder require you to stop pnpm start and start it again in order for those to take effect. This is a limitation of the quick nature of this repo_

### `pnpm test`

Launches the test runner.\
See the section about [running tests](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) for more information.

### `pnpm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `public/assets` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
